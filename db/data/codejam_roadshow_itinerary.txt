SAP CodeJam Roadshow 2024
Developer Advocate Rich Heilman
Yes, someone did say “Roadshow”! Attention SAP Developers! 
Thomas Jung and I are hitting the road again this year for another SAP CodeJam Roadshow in Europe.
Last year, we drove about 1500km around Germany and the Netherlands, I don’t think we will be doing that again anytime soon.
This time the roadshow is a bit more spread out geographically, so it will be planes and trains for us this time.
We will have 5 stops on the roadshow from April 12th through April 22nd 2024.
Below is a listing of the SAP CodeJam events on the roadshow schedule:
- ABAP Cloud & RESTful Application Programming Model 04/12/2024 Amsterdam, Netherlands
- ABAP Cloud & RESTful Application Programming Model 04/15/2024 Bucharest, Romania
- ABAP Cloud & RESTful Application Programming Model 04/17/2024 Leverkusen, Germany
- ABAP Cloud & RESTful Application Programming Model 04/19/2024 Paris, France
- ABAP Cloud/RAP & CAP 04/22/2024 Madrid, Spain

I have a feeling these events will fill up fast, so if you want to join us for a day of coding awesomeness, make sure to register to secure your seat.
I’d also like to take a second and thank our hosts for partnering with us on these events.
Thanks to PVH and Partners in Technology in Amsterdam, IBM in Bucharest, Covestro in Leverkusen, VINCI Energies in Paris,
and of course our own Antonio Maradiaga at SAP Espana in Madrid.

See you all somewhere in Europe on the roadshow!
